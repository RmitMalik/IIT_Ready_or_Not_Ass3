                        <p>
                            Throughout the team, we have strong leaders and meticulous executors.
                            We also have attentive defender, which is already the quality
                            needed for a potential team. According to the results of the
                            Myers-Briggs test for each person in the team, we are delighted
                            that each of us has a different personality. There are defender,
                            entrepreneur, and consul among us. They are very well organised
                            when they get toghter. They are also willing to lend a helping
                            hand when their teammates are in trouble. This is why they are
                            the one of the best choices to be a co-workers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In fact, our team is not mature enough, that means we need to
                            keep learning, so it is also particularly important to know
                            the learning habits of each team member. We are pleased to find
                            that the learning styles of our team members cover all three
                            learning styles: visual, tactile and auditory. We are pleased
                            to see that the learning styles of our team members cover all
                            three learning styles: visual, tactile and auditory. Each of
                            us has different ways and methods of acquiring knowledge. When
                            such people form a team, the team can acquire and develop knowledge
                            from different ways and means at the same time. Consequently, this
                            team can develop and mature much faster than others.

                                course with Rmit University. This is my first
                                year and first semester, so everything is new
                                to me! I love building computers and putting
                                together things and love to find out more about
                                how things work together.

                                The role of software developer and engineer is to focus on the application of principles
                                regarding engineering to software development, analysing what is needed to bring the
                                idea to life. Through his role, he develops the idea and the prototype, to demonstrate
                                the practicality and usefulness of the idea. The aspect undertaken by Malik is crucial
                                to the success of the project, as he must make sure all aspects of the theoretical side
                                are implementeed into the prototype.

                                My name is Adrian Ghitoaica, I am Romanian,
                                currently undergoing my bachelor’s in
                                construction management (Honours) in second
                                year, I can speak Romanian, and I like outdoor
                                activities like fishing, camping. I am pursuing
                                my first degree and am set to graduate by 2024
                                if everything goes well. I believe an understanding
                                of IT will support me in future, and enhance my
                                skillset, hence choosing this course.

                                The role of Adrian is the Project Administrator, due to the focus on the role to define
                                the aims, roles and timeframe of the project. Through defining the key aspects, the
                                project can pursue itself naturally, with the set timeframe for job completion avoiding
                                a delay in completion. The timeframe aspect is core to development as it ensures each
                                member remains disciplined in their roles and completes their workload in the specified
                                time. Therefore, each member is important to the success and longevity of the project.

                                Ihthisham is the Project Advisor, due to his focus being on the risk aspect of the
                                project. However, Ihthisham has been crucial in the early stages of the project,
                                forwarding the initial idea to the team of ReadyDiet, demonstrating initiative early on
                                in the project. With the knowledge of this team member, the project can excel and turn
                                to reality, as Ihthisham can advise us of risks or problems along the way which may
                                arise internally within the project.

                                    kilojoules, ingredients and everything else that is in the
                                    food. The software can also keep track of all food that you
                                    have eaten, all food you have bought and all food you have
                                    stored away. Another cool feature of this software is the
                                    recipe lookup, it checks to see what foods are in the inventory
                                    and scores the web for recipes that can be made with what’s
                                    available This software is a sort of food organizing, monitoring
                                    and developing software which helps users watch their calorie intake,
                                    cook healthy meals and know what they are missing in their fridges or
                                    storages.

                                    This project will help millions if not billions of people. Everyone
                                    wants to eat healthy and be the perfect weight and make sure they are
                                    getting enough nutrients, however not everyone has the time to figure
                                    out a plan or has the money to afford a nutritional expert to guide
                                    them. Just opening this application and adding your food items that
                                    you eat throughout the day is enough to tell you if you are going
                                    over your limits or not, making it 10x easier than doing the research
                                    and paying a professional. Furthermore, keeping track of the items,
                                    you buy and what you are missing for your plans helps you organize
                                    and possibly save money on certain food aspects. This software will
                                    be the go-to application to figure out a 5-star meal plan and ingredient

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    There are already apps that help with dietary needs and organizing fridges and
                                    pantries such as Fridge Pal, fridge check, calorie counter app, Lite n’ easy. These
                                    are some of many of our competitors in our current market however they do not and
                                    will not provide the services and extra utilities that come with our ReadyDiet
                                    software. We gain a long advantage by combining both the likes of a dietary
                                    application and a food product organizing application both into one software for all
                                    your food product needs. Another large point of difference is that many of these
                                    applications require confusing and sometimes annoying process not to mention the
                                    costs to keep these applications running as well.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The core aim of the project is to develop a tool which is found in most households
                                    domestically, essentially the creation of a barcode scanner integrated into a
                                    fridge. The product monitors the consumption experienced by the user, and in turn
                                    allows the user to monitor the amount of calories they are consuming, which is
                                    especially useful for those engaged in physical exercise and demand an accurate
                                    measurement of calories consumed. In turn, the long-term aim is to see this product
                                    marketed not only to a small group of physical exercise enthusiasts but instead to
                                    the entire domestic market as a whole, to ensure that the general public maintain
                                    high health standards for themselves.

                                    <h4>Finding the tools to create the project</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The first goal to enforce the idea, is to find the tools needed to create such a
                                    product. Through finding what is required to bring the project to life, the team can
                                    then go ahead and develop the technology and find suitable interfaces which make the
                                    use of the product easiest for the consumer. When the right tools are provided, then
                                    the project can be pursued at the most efficient rate, which can lower the cost and
                                    time involved with the creation of the project.

                                    <h4>Ascertaining the target market / demographic</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The second goal for the project is to find the demographic which the product is
                                    targeted towards. Through finding the target market, the team can come to a
                                    conclusion whether the product is financially viable upon completion, and determine
                                    if there is enough demand for the product at the end. Through finding out the
                                    market, the product itself can be marketed towards those most likely to buy it, and
                                    in turn raise revenue. Therefore, finding the core demographic is key to the success
                                    of the product.

                                    <h4>Creating the software required</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    Through creating the software, the team is able to test ‘loosely’ if the concept
                                    will work prior to the integration of the scanner into a physical fridge. This goal
                                    must be reached before the project can progress, as without cleaning up the software
                                    side of things, the physical prototype success will be unattainable. Therefore, the
                                    software must be complete, for the project to enter its next phase of development.

                                    <h4>Creating physical prototypes</h4>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The creation of physical prototypes is imperative to the success of the project, and
                                    will be completed upon the creation of the software, which will aim to make user
                                    interface easy. The physical prototype will be in the form of creation of the
                                    barcode scanner first, which will provide details of the food scanned, and show the
                                    calories and nutritional statistics of the scanned food. The final form of the
                                    prototype will be implementation into a fridge interface, as the product must be
                                    integrated without appearing too ‘clunky’ or unappealing. Therefore, the success of
                                    this goal is important to the project in its entirety.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    The project will be complete once all patent and trademarks are attained, and the
                                    product can now be shown to major electronics brands, and marketed to be integrated
                                    into their existing products, such as Hisense and Samsung. Through achieving the
                                    implementation of the product into a widespread major brand, the product can achieve
                                    its end goal of the lifespan and return finances to the project owners. The market
                                    implementation will be difficult, but once achieved, mark the end of the project,
                                    and the success of it at the same time.

                                    Python will be ReadyDiet’s main software language. It’s a high-level programming
                                    language and is highly recommend for many programmers out there. Its highly
                                    interpreted with built in structures and is used for building websites, automated
                                    tasks Aswell as software which make it a attractive development language. Since
                                    python is free to use no software licenses would be needed. Python can be used to
                                    make a variety of different programs into one software which makes it ideal for our
                                    project since there are a few integrations such as the barcode scanner and the
                                    storage system Aswell as the product lookup aspect. Python can be used for mobile,
                                    web and desktop applications which Is a requirement for our software as it is
                                    supposed to operate on not only mobile devices but also desktops, laptops and common
                                    operating systems. Python can actually be used for quick prototyping Aswell.

                                        the number of data being inputted or it can crash. The families will also be of
                                        different backgrounds and cultures. This is to test whether the application can
                                        pick up diverse ranges of foods in our databases. These tests will also help us
                                        fill in any missing items into our database.

                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;We will find these users to test our application by asking randoms
                                        on the street if they are interested with the benefit of having a free diet
                                        monitoring application to use early. If the users get really hard to find, we
                                        will work with research recruitment agencies to fulfill our tests. Ofcourse the
                                        software will be limited to its features however more beta roll outs will
                                        continue and more tests will be done to improve our application.

                            There are roughly three kinds of major outputs from our project. Software should be our
                            primary
                            output, which includes, but is not limited to, customer-side applications in the user's
                            personal
                            device (e.g. smartphone/smartwatch). There is also business-side software used by production
                            merchants/manufacturers. In order to enable the software to read the required information
                            from
                            the QR code/barcode, we also plan to offer a public protocol specification for storing the
                            information that we need in a specific format. Because it is a public protocol
                            specification, it
                            can be easily reused by other products, thus further helping us to create a commercial
                            ecosystem. In order to promote our software more widely so that it can reach more embedded
                            devices (e.g. refrigerators). We may also need to experiment with hardware products that
                            allow
                            embedded devices to install or interact with our software.

                            For the sake of time, we have only planned the most major programs so far. In this
                            development
                            cycle, we are planning to implement a user application for IOS first, which will be called
                            ReadyDiet. After that, we should also need to build the corresponding back-end services for
                            ReadyDiet. So far, we have discussed and identified some basic information about our
                            application. For example what features it will contains. The colour style of its theme. The
                            development language and the technology stack etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;
                            We discussed the features that should be included in our application, firstly the core base
                            function of our application - the scan code, which should be extremely basic and essential.
                            Then
                            we needed to parse and store the information that was scanned. And as mentioned in the
                            project
                            plan, the information will be analysed to remind the user.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;
                            We initially planned to use Python for our application development as it was simple
                            enough and
                            would save us a lot of time. But we learnt that python is not suitable for developing
                            IOS
                            applications. So we had to use Swift to develop the app for IOS, which fortunately was
                            just as
                            simple. In the meantime, we plan to use python to develop future back-end services. But
                            in the
                            end we discovered that python has a Kivy library that allows us to develop IOS
                            applications
                            using python. So we finally returned to our initial decision to develop the whole
                            project in
                            python.

                                We also considered whether to use Jira or Trello for project management, but after
                                careful
                                discussion we felt that although it was necessary, we could not use it yet, at least at
                                the
                                beginning of the project. We plan to use Trello to manage the project when it is well
                                underway.

                                We are currently working on a prototype of the application - what it will looks like and
                                how it
                                responds to the user's actions. Almost all of us had no experience in prototyping, so to
                                simplify our work, we chose proto.io instead of figma. proto.io is simpler and allows us
                                to drag
                                and drop the corresponding components directly to design

                                We are all well aware that this is a huge project and if we need to hand over the
                                project to
                                another team at the end of this term. Then the most important thing is that we need to
                                make sure
                                the other team knows what our project is about, our project plan and the current
                                progress of our
                                project. Therefore, as can be expected, we will have many synchronous handover meetings.
                                During
                                the meeting , we will explain our project goals, starting from how we came up with the
                                idea for
                                the project, to how it finally takes shapes. Next we will try to explain our project
                                plan and
                                the current progress of this project. In the meantime, we will gradually hand over the
                                resources
                                we have for this project during this process, such as the github repository, the
                                proto.io
                                organisation and related documentation, etc. Then we will give the new team some time to
                                work
                                independently on our project, during this time, they are allowed to ask us any questions
                                they
                                met about the project to ensure a smooth handover.

                                If I were one of the people who took over. I hope I can be taught to understand what
                                each line
                                of code does. Of course I know this is not possible. Anyway, I hope that during the
                                handover
                                process I can quickly become familiar with every detail of the whole project. Thus I can
                                start
                                the subsequent work better.

                        In this project, we used Teams as the main team communication tool. Basically all communication
                        takes place in teams. We basically meet twice a week, the first time on Wednesday, which is an
                        offline meeting where we synchronise each of us in the classroom with our individual progress
                        from the previous week and work together for two hours. Then a second meeting is booked for the
                        week, which is usually on a Friday afternoon.
                        <br><br>
                        In the second meeting on Friday afternoon we will summarise our work for the week and then plan
                        everyone's tasks for the following week. This is a short meeting and we will record the meeting
                        for review purposes. In week 13, both meetings became online meetings. As Assignment 3 closes at
                        the end of the week, our Wednesday meeting briefly summarised the final work we needed to do for
                        Assignment 3. And there will be one final meeting at the end of the week.
                        <br><br>
                        During the course of the meetings, we did have people who were not able to attend because they
                        had other commitments. This is not avoided and our current solution is to skip the absentees for
                        the time being. Then use Teams to synchronise progress and assign tasks with the absent person
                        via messages.

                                        Right now, Behavioral Analytics is a baseline requirement for advanced security
                                        in systems. It can use data and algorithms Aswell as machine learning to point
                                        out unusual behavior within applications or software which can help identify
                                        malicious behavior that are linked to certain types of attacks. Behavioral
                                        analytics can also help uncover root causes of attacks and provide insights on
                                        the attack.
                                    </p>

                                        Behavioral analytics can uncover malicious behavior by pointing out unusual
                                        timing of events and increased data movement for example.

                                        One of the biggest applications of behavioral analytics in security is detecting
                                        insider threats. This is where an employee of a company for example decides to
                                        go against his own company for personal reasons. Since an employee has access to
                                        personal company information no hacking is required. This is where behavioral
                                        analytics comes into play by detecting the employee's unusual behavior.

                                        The future of behavioral Analytics in cybersecurity is promising. Analytics will
                                        be able to fortify their defenses against cyber-attacks and will be able to
                                        respond and resolve issues faster and more efficiently. Behavioral analytics is
                                        rising in popularity due to data increasing every day. The more data being used
                                        the more security that can be provided through behavioral analytics as it can
                                        sift through all information and data given making it easier to point out
                                        unusual behavior. Behavioral analytics is not only used in security, but the
                                        future of behavioral analytics is also used in e commerce and finance. In the
                                        future, consumers won't even have to search for what they are looking for, it
                                        will be suggested to them through advertisements on television and websites and
                                        on their phones. People will be surrounded by their interests as their behavior
                                        online is all being monitored to give them what they are looking for. Behavioral
                                        analytics will help companies identify products that are most popular and help
                                        achieve success. AI technology contributes to behavioral analytics future as AI
                                        assistants and virtual assistants are becoming smarter and more advanced.
                                        behavioral analytics can make AI become more closer to humans than ever,

                                        either way. AI, machine learning, robots and robotic process which use
                                        behavioral analytics will make widespan redundancies in jobs or technologies
                                        making automation a common solution to business and people, but it will make the
                                        most out of data, AI and business advertising technologies. Analyzing and
                                        reporting people's behavior online and knowing their every move will make

                                        love the internet and devices and electronics and what it provides will be the
                                        most affected by this technology. Knowing people's behavior will potentially
                                        even stop major crime and predict future events, this could create an
                                        understanding of how certain processes or things are used and why such things
                                        happen. More analysis also leads to more insight for asking the right questions,
                                        behavioral analytics can lead scientists and people who are curious into the
                                        right direction. For example, in security we can use behavioral analytics to ask

                                        In my daily life, I will be suggested products every day that I won't even have
                                        to think about because my behavior online was matched with this product which I
                                        was initially interested in. Suspicious behavior that occurs on my devices or
                                        applications or accounts will be marked and will be notified to me instantly
                                        making my daily security exceptional and will leave me stress free. However
                                        personally, behavioral analytics makes me uncomfortable or gives me a feeling of
                                        no privacy. I feel like my life is monitored 24/7 and I cannot escape anything
                                        that I do online. My family members interests will be suggested on sites and
                                        YouTube for example the things they like will start to come up on suggestions
                                        and will make me more familiar with their hobbies which is a good thing. I can
                                        use behavioral analytics to my advantage to see what IT jobs are in demand and
                                        what employers are looking for in IT students to help me with my future. I could
                                        gain more broad knowledge on my interests and learn extensively about the things
                                        that interest me as more content and data is suggested to me. For example,
                                        through the amount of time I spend on certain websites. My life will become more
                                        simplified as AI assistants can help understand and memories what I look for
                                        everyday and the way I live my life. They could remind me to do certain things
                                        in the morning which I consecutively do everyday, they can guide me giving me
                                        directions to where im going in the car. Behavioral analytics in general will
                                        simplify not only Security but also business practices, IOT and life practices.

                                        Rasberry Pi is essentially a small sized computer that can be used just like a
                                        normal computer. Plugged in to a monitor with a mouse and keyboard, it is
                                        capable of playing High-definition video and can do pretty much everything a
                                        normal desk top can do.
                                    </p>

                                        It is very tiny, cheap and highly versatile computer that can fit into your
                                        pocket. There is a variety of uses for a rasberry pi which include using it for
                                        coding projects. You can use an entire operating systems with rasberry Pi such
                                        as Linux which is the main open source operating system for rasberry Pi. The
                                        main language for rasberry pie is Python. There are many different models of
                                        rasberry pi depending on the use that you have in mind for it. You can create a
                                        entire web server with PI and can stay on 24/7 without having to pay a massive
                                        electric bill, its also perfectly fast enough to handle loading up web pages and
                                        within local networks. The fact that the cheapest Raspberry Pi is around $4 USD
                                        and the most expensive version being $70 USD, (its about $60 AUD to 150 AUD
                                        now!), this is due to chip prices rising and the pandemic forced Raspberry pi to
                                        increase its prices. that alone shows its popularity and extraordinary features
                                        for its price. It is deemed the future of computing devices due to its ability
                                        to make use of IOT and being less expensive then most computing devices. The
                                        Rasberry Pi 4 allows you to play video games at 60 frames a second with inbuilt
                                        wifi and bluetooth to support wireless internet. Additionally the PI 4 gives you
                                        the capability to boot from a pen drive or USB attached drive, this will allow
                                        easing of remotely updating its systems and sharing system images between
                                        different machines which is an amazing feature considering its size its amazing.
                                        Raspberry Pi works best along side a desktop PC to enhance its functions such as
                                        online services, web browsing, office applications, and can act as extra memory
                                        even!

                                        impact on education and the world of computers. It has sold more than 40
                                        miillion units (cambridge uni) which have been used in numerous ways to benefit
                                        the world. Raspberry pi created a new class of computers, single board computers
                                        which make engineers, teachers, programmers and students lifes easier, cheaper
                                        and funner in every way possible. Raspberry Pi even has online resources where
                                        coding clubs, programmes and competitions have been provided to millions and
                                        millions of people from around the world providing excellent education and
                                        knowledge at a low cost.

                                        Since raspberry Pis are cheaper compared to other computers, this changes the
                                        way I shop for new computers. It makes me take into consideration the credit
                                        card sized computer that could do everything a normal laptop or pc can do for a
                                        fraction of a cost. Its logically the better choice to go with a raspberry pi
                                        unless im looking for something specific. My families and friends will also take
                                        into consideration of raspberry pi not just for personal use but to learn more
                                        about the world of computing, raspberry pi will also get them into programming
                                        and what it has to offer. This opens up educational opportunities and even
                                        possible future pathways that might change their mind on what they are doing
                                        right now. Whether its creating whole programming scripts or creating fun
                                        projects like a water dispenser or Bee/wasp counter, Raspberry Pi does not hold
                                        out on the fun it has, even building simple things. Perosnally iv gained
                                        interest into starting my own Raspberry Pi project where I use its touchscreen
                                        add on to create a small touch screen device which connects to my computer and
                                        displays statistics and information on my pc like temperature and ram usage.
                                        Ofcourse we can just use Raspberry Pi for fun but there's a whole world to
                                        explore with such a small device.

                                        Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software to
                                        predict outcomes without being programmed or told to do so. Its based on
                                        algorithms and uses historical data to predict all its outputs. Machine learning
                                        provides with

                                        All these beneifts help businesses and or scientists to predict outcomes easily.
                                        For example, a business that sells a new product can predict its sell rate by
                                        accessing human purchase data to see what products are most bought and it will
                                        do its magic to figure out a algorithm to show how successful this new product
                                        may be. Many leading companies of today use machine learning such as Facebook,
                                        google and uber. Machine learning helps with decision making within applications

                                                Supervised machine learning consists of learning a function based on a
                                                input and out put of labeled data. For example, giving 3 apples and 2
                                                bananas to a model that is using unsupervised machine learning will
                                                predict that it's an apple and banana while a supervised machine model
                                                will show exactly 3 apples and 2 bananas. Basically its developing
                                                predictive models based on both inputs and outputs of data.

                                        Speech recognition is one of many machines learning technologies which is a
                                        computer speech recognition or speech to text technology which allows users to
                                        use a microphone to speak and allows the computer to process the human speech
                                        into a written format. An example of this technology is Siri on apple iPhone.

                                        Computer vision is my favorite and most interesting technology in my opinion
                                        that uses machine learning. This AI technology enables computers and systems to
                                        derive meaningful information from digital images and any other online visual
                                        inputs. Based on the data it pulls from those visual representations it can take
                                        action. Image recognition, photo tagging, radiology imaging in healthcare and
                                        self-driving cars are all part of machine learning computer vision technology.

                                        There are many more technologies to list that use machine learning. Thanks to
                                        the enormous amount of data technology has created today, machine learning is

                                        technologies listed above will be completely unrecognizable and unbelievable.
                                        quantum computing has also made machine learning possible as it enables faster
                                        data processing which boosts machine learning capabilities. Googles quantum

                                        These autonomous vehicles rely on sensors, complex algorithms, machine learning
                                        systems and powerful processors to execute code and software. Their radar
                                        sensors can pick up surroundings and create and maintain a map of nearby
                                        vehicles and the environment. They could even pick up and understand stop signs,
                                        pedestrians using some light detections and ranging. Sensors bounce pulses of
                                        light off the cars surroundings to measure distances, detect road edges and
                                        identify road markings.

                                        Advanced driver assistance technology right now is able to prevent crashes and
                                        lane departure prevention as well as blind spot detection and rear crash
                                        prevention systems. These technologies make our lives easier and our driving
                                        better and more comfortable. These technologies were then followed up by many
                                        car brands such as Mercedes which took autonomous vehicles even further when
                                        they introduced drive pilot which allows the driver to hand over direct control
                                        of steering, speed and even supervising overall operation of the car. Tesla is
                                        the biggest integrator of autonomous vehicles. They have a auto lane changer,
                                        autopilot navigation, auto park, summoning the vehicle from a parking spot or

                                        As of right now, removing the drivers attention completely is not yet possible.
                                        An extra set of eyes is still needed to keep control of the vehicle. Most

                                        Human errors in cars are what cause nearly all crashes today. This can be solved
                                        through autonomous vehicles as accurate computers and software do not make
                                        errors so imagine of millions of these autonomous cars are on the road at the
                                        same time, there will be no need for traffic lights. For instance, rear ending a
                                        vehicle since you weren't paying attention cannot be caused by an autonomous
                                        car. Autonomous vehicles are safer in preventing types of accidents that have to
                                        do with human error.

                                        Who will need 8 airbags and a heavy chunk of metal to protect them when
                                        accidents are so rare? Who needs a parking spot when your car can come pick you
                                        up from work later? Who needs to book a flight when you can leave whenever you
                                        like sleeping half of the time and arrive at your destination swiftly.

                                        Taxi and limousine industries will substantially be impacted or could even
                                        potentially create new ones to be used with autonomous vehicles.

                                        Autonomous vehicles in the future will be more reliable and safer than being
                                        driven by a human due to all the advances in technology. Generally autonomous
                                        vehicles will rely on camera technology especially since new cameras recently
                                        are able to generate 3d measurements at long range and since future platforms
                                        will be strongly driven by both safety and cost considerations.

                                        Autnomous vehicles will also make jobs such as truck drivers redundant, now me
                                        personally I love to hear this news because I do not like truck drivers however
                                        since this self driving tech is so widespread and is in mass development
                                        transporting goods in trucks will be automated in the future. This means that
                                        suppliers may invest in automated transportation rather then paying employees to
                                        deliver their goods. Not only that but at the same time;

                                        Howevrer there are some cons and risks too such as cyber attacks. Imagine
                                        getting your supply track hacked and being driven the opposite direction then
                                        losing track of its location. Extensive software maintance and upgrades will
                                        also include high cost of integration and use which will take lots of business
                                        time aswell but in the long run the future is very promising and is looking to
                                        make many of our lives easier in a way.

                                        Not just me, everyone in my life and around me will be dramatically impacted by
                                        this technology in the future. Growing up as a teenager I needed to get my
                                        license and Ps to drive around in my car acting cool, with autonomous vehicles
                                        there will be no need for a license as the car itself tests to see if you are
                                        able to drive it or not. Parents won't have to pick me up from my soccer games
                                        as I can just tap my phone and the car will come by and pick me up on time.
                                        Going to school in the morning couldn’t be easier, getting dropped off on time
                                        by car. Travelling around the country in general will be much easier and more
                                        comfortable. transport business won't need licensed drivers as they begin to
                                        order autonomous vehicles which drive themselves through applications getting
                                        called by users transporting them to their location and staying on standby till
                                        it is called to a nearby location again. We would be relying on our vehicles
                                        heavily and most people around the world would be finding it easier autonomously
                                        getting driven to their destination. Everyone would be entrusting software to
                                        deliver them from point A to point B.
